# (optional) When enabled, function boundary analysis will be skipped.
# Only valid _after_ initial analysis has been performed and
# the symbols and splits files have been generated. 
quick_analysis: false

# (optional) When enabled, the analyzer will attempt to detect sizes
# and data types of objects based on code usage and alignment.

# (optional) When enabled, the analyzer will attempt to detect strings,
# wide strings, and string tables.

# (optional) Whether to write disassembly to the split output directory.
# While not used in the build process, the disassembly is useful
# for reading and usage with other tools, like decomp.me.

# (optional) If symbols are _fully_ known (e.g. from a complete map file),
# this can be set to true to skip most analysis steps, and ensure new
# symbols are not created by the analyzer.
# If you're not sure, leave this false.

# (optional) Whether to create `gap_` symbols to prevent the linker from
# adjusting the alignment / address of symbols.
# When alignments are fully known (e.g. from a complete map file),
# this can be set to false.
fill_gaps: true

# (optional) By default, emitted objects will "export" all symbols (force active).
# This is useful to prevent the linker from removing any symbols.
# Individual symbols can be excluded using `noexport` in the symbols file.
